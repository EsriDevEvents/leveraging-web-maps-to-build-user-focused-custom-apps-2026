# Leveraging Web Maps to Build User-Focused Custom Apps

Move away from hard-coding maps in your apps and learn how you can take full advantage of web maps in the ArcGIS Maps SDKs to build map-driven, user-focused apps. Web maps provide a framework for building common, rich experiences, whether you are building a web app for a decision maker or a mobile app for a fieldworker. Apps that use web maps enable you to more easily update or reuse your application by deploying new maps, instead of new apps. Attend this technical session to gain insights into maximizing the potential of web maps, including visualization, editing, and alerts.
